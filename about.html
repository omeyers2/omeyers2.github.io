<h1>About me</h1>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>


<p> Hi, my name is Olivia Meyers, and I am a sophomore at UW-Madison majoring in marketing and pursuing a certificate in digital studies. I am from Randolph, New Jersey, but moving to Wisconsin was a smoother transition than I expected. I made this blog because I am so passionate about being a badger and I wanted to share all of the great aspects of UW with the world. Whether you are trying to decide where to go to college, visiting Madison soon, or just want to hear about the life of a college student at UW, this is the blog for you!</p>


<p>My involvement on campus is varied and unique to what I am passionate about. I am a member of the sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and I am actually living on Langdon (frat row) in the sorority house this year. AdClub and Ad Agency are other organizations I am involved in through the business school. Community service and being active in my community is also very important to me, so I joined the Business Badgers and Beyond volunteer service student organization this year. </p>


<h3>Some fun facts about me:</h3>
<p>I am a huge sports fan! Growing up watching football and baseball with my dad set me up to be the ultimate UW Football fan. I also participated in field hockey and softball throughout high school, so I love to be active and compete as well. I love music (even though I am not the best singer). </p>

<h4>My top 5 favorite artists:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Mac Miller</li>
    <li>Billy Joel</li>
    <li>Joji</li>
    <li>Juice World</li>
    <li>Yung Gravy (a UW alum!)</li>
</ol>
