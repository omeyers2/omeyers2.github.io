<p>The B-School at UW offers its students so many amazing features and benefits. From tutoring to business student orgs to study spaces, being a business student at UW provides you with amazing opportunities and advantages.

<h3>My Advice:</h3>

   <ul>

    <li>Get to know your professors and TAs! Answer questions in class, introduce yourself after class or in an email, go to office hours, add them on LinkedIn, etc.</li>

    <li>Go to office hours/ask for help if you need it! I did not take advantage of this enough my first semester freshman year. This is a great way to form those relationships with your professors and TAs and is incredibly helpful when you're struggling with any of the class material.</li>

    <li>Go to the library or a coffee shop to study. In my opinion, studying in your dorm room or apartment, where you sleep, eat, and relax, is tough and at times, distracting. Studying in another environment that promotes learning helps me be more productive and focused!</li>
    
    <li>Join study groups and student orgs! They are super helpful and a great way to make new friends in your classes. I am so happy that I have met so many unique students in different classes throughout my college career so far.</li>

     <li>Make appointments and get help from your advisor. UW's advising services are great resources on campus to help guide you through your college experience.</li>

    <li>Have a schedule and stay organized!</li>

     <li>Have an open mind to all subjects, courses, people, professors, ideas, etc! You will be pleasantly surprised by how many new things you will be exposed to and get the chance to experience, so approach them with open arms! You may find new passions and interests you never even knew about before getting to UW.</li>

    <li>Also... GO TO CLASS!!! This may seem obvious, but it can be so tempting to just sleep in or skip. A lot more students fall victim to this than you would expect, but it is incredibly important to attend all of your lectures and discussions. t</li>

</ul>

<h3>Student Orgs</h3>
  
<p>Some really popular student orgs offered in the business school that either I or some of my friends are members of and enjoy, include: Women in Business, Business Badger Professionals, Diversity in Business, Business Badgers and Beyond, Sports Business Club, MKT, Ad Club, Multicultural Business Association, Fantasy Sports and Finance Club...</p>

<p>For more information about the business student orgs that I am a member of, click <a href="activities.html">here!</a></p>

<p>Business student orgs offer friendships, diversity, networking opportunities, advice from guest speakers, mentorships, internship opportunities, community service/volunteer work, etc. I highly recommend getting involved on campus this way!</p>
