<h1>Involvement on Campus!</h1>

<h2>Activities, Student Orgs, and Events on Campus</h2>

<h3>Greek Life</h3>

<p>I am a proud member of the sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma (KKG). Being involved in Greek Life has introduced me to some of my best friends and brought me some of the best experiences I have had on campus so far.</p>

<p>My sorority's philanthropy is called Reading is Fundamental, which is an organization that helps underprivileged girls have access to books and school supplies to be successful in their education. Every year, we host and participate in events to raise money and awareness for this organization.</p>
<h4>A few include:</h4>


    <h2>Hoops for Hope</h2>

	<p>This event was playing and coaching in a basketball tournament to 	fundraise for our philanthropy! We raised $12,000 last year and had a 	great time doing it!</p>


    <h2>Grabba Grabba Pizza</h2>

<p>Grabba Grabba Pizza is a late night philanthropy event where each member has a shift to fundraise for Reading is Key by selling pizza on Langdon.</p>

    <h2>Humorology</h2>

<p>Humorology, or "Humo" is a student-run philanthropic variety show that a lot of Greek Life is involved in. We are paired with a few other fraternities or sororities and the freshman act, dance, and perform in the show. There are frequent practices and fun events through Humo that really helps with meeting new people as a freshman. The philanthropy that everyone is raising money for is Blessings in a Backpack, a national nonprofit organization that works to feed children who might otherwise go hungry by performing in the show and promoting the event to family and friends.</p>


<h3>AdClub and Ad Agency</h3>

<p>I am so incredibly happy that I decided to join this student organization, and I actually decided to join by myself and step out of my comfort zone. I have met a lot of other really amazing students studying so many unique majors and schools in UW. Every Tuesday, we hear from a different guest speaker or speakers who have experience in the marketing and advertising fields. We also have socials and field trips to Ad Agencies in Chicago a few times a semester as well. I have learned so much from the guests and get the chance to network with them! The student organization also offers the chance to join Ad Agency. I get to be appointed a role on a team with other members to work with real clients in Madison! I am currently working on an advertising/promotional campaign for a company called Bandit Tortilleria, and my position is the social media specialist. Joining a student organization on campus is a great way to get involved and meet new people!</p>

<h3>Business Badgers and Beyond</h3>

<p>This is the only business school organization that focuses primarily on volunteerism. I get to participate in numerous community service opportunities and hear from various speakers who give business advice and talk about the importance of volunteerism in the business world. I get to meet new students within the business school, give back to the Madison community, and develop my professional skills all at the same time! Definitely try to get involved in a student org that gives back and makes the world a better place :)</p>

<h3>Madison Business Mentoring (MBM)</h3>

<p>I just recently joined this student org and absolutely love it! MBM connects current students with UW alumni in a mentor/mentee relationship. Everything is driven/initiated by the student, and you get what you put into it. You get paired with an alumni who works in a similar field to your major and interests. I am paired with a digital marketer and strategist and love learning about his career, college experiences, internships, etc. through informational interviews and frequent meetings. He is also helping me with my resume, cover letters, interviews, and internship/job searching. I am really happy I got involved in MBM and get to learn from awesome people.</p>
